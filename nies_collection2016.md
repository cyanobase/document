About Genome Sequencing Project of the NIES cyanobacteria collection 2016
---------------

Cyanobacteria are prokaryotic organisms that perform oxygen-evolving photosynthesis. 
Several cyanobacteria strains have been used as a model organism in the research 
fields of photosynthesis, photoacclimation, bloom formation, and metabolic engineering.
On the other hand, the cyanobacteria phylum comprised morphologically, physiologically 
and genetically diverse strains and they are broadly distributed in the terrestrial
and aquatic environments. Understanding of cyanobacteria diversity via genome sequencing 
of the strains deposited in the culture collection is becoming a new trend. 
The aim of this project is to comprehensively analyze the genomes of cyanobacteria strains 
in the National Collection of the National Institute for Environmental Studies (NIES) in Japan. 

In 2016, we focused on the 20 cyanobacteria strains that can form heterocyst, a thick walled 
differentiated cell for nitrogen fixiation. The genome size of the heterocystous cyanobacteria 
is relatively large (5-12M bp) and contains many repeated sequences, which make it difficult 
to obtain high quality genome information. We sequenced the PCR-free and the long mate pair 
DNA libraries of these strains using the MiSeq sequencer, and performed in silico gap closing 
and Sanger sequencing. The assembled genomes were annotated the manually curated annotation 
in the genome database Cyanobase. 
These data will facilitate our understanding of diversity and evolution of the molecular processes 
among cyanobacteria phylum. This project is supported by the National Bio Resource Project in Japan. 


Summary of Project Results
---------------
Cyanobacteria are gram-negative bacteria that perform oxygen-evolving photosynthesis. 
They are utilized in many research fields such as molecular mechanism of photosynthesis, 
formation of algae bloom in aquatic environments, and biomass production by genetic engineering. 
Recent progress of the next-generation sequencing technologies enables researchers 
to analyze the genomes of diverse cyanobacteria strains deposited in the culture collection 
of each country (Shih et al 2013 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.). In Japan, culture collection of 
the National Institute of Environment and Studies (NIES), which is one of the core institutions 
of National BioResource Project (NBRP), harbors total 56 genus and 933 species of cyanobacteria strains, 
but genomes of only three NIES strains have been sequenced.
In this project, we performed genome sequencing of the NIES cyanobacteria strains that are capable of 
forming heterocysts, differentiated cells for nitrogen fixiation. This project was performed by 
the three organizations: NIES, Toyohashi University of Technology, and National Institute of Genetics. 
NIES performed cultivation of strains and purification of their genomic DNA. Toyohashi University of 
Technology performed next generation sequencing and genome assembly. National Institute of Genetics 
performed genome annotation and data release. In the NCBI assembly database, quality of genome assembly 
is classified with four levels: complete, chromosome, scaffolds, and contigs. The complete and chromosome 
level assemblies are desirable for the practical use of scientists. We sequenced 31 heterocystous strains 
and succeeded to determine 7 genomes with complete level, 23 genomes with chromosome level and a genome 
with scaffold level. These genome sequences were subjected to prediction and annotation of genes using 
DFAST pipeline (https://dfast.nig.ac.jp/). Currently, genome data of about 120 cyanobacteria strains with 
complete or chromosome levels are available. Taken together with genomes of other 9 NIES strains, which were 
sequenced previously, genome data of total 40 NIES strains were released in the cyanobacteria database 
CyanoBase (http://genome.microbedb.jp/cyanobase). Our genome data of the NIES strains will be useful for 
many researchres in both basic and applied studies. In addition, this project facilitated the collaboration 
of scientists who is responsible for management of culture collection, next generation sequencing facilities, 
bioinformatics tools and database in Japan.
