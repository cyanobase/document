About Genome Sequencing Project of the NIES cyanobacteria collection 2016
---------------

Cyanobacteria are prokaryotic organisms that perform oxygen-evolving photosynthesis. 
Several cyanobacteria strains have been used as a model organism in the research 
fields of photosynthesis, photoacclimation, bloom formation, and metabolic engineering.
On the other hand, the cyanobacteria phylum comprised morphologically, physiologically 
and genetically diverse strains and they are broadly distributed in the terrestrial
and aquatic environments. Understanding of cyanobacteria diversity via genome sequencing 
of the strains deposited in the culture collection is becoming a new trend. 
The aim of this project is to comprehensively analyze the genomes of cyanobacteria strains 
in the National Collection of the National Institute for Environmental Studies (NIES) in Japan. 

In 2016, we focused on the 20 cyanobacteria strains that can form heterocyst, a thick walled 
differentiated cell for nitrogen fixiation. The genome size of the heterocystous cyanobacteria 
is relatively large (5-12M bp) and contains many repeated sequences, which make it difficult 
to obtain high quality genome information. We sequenced the PCR-free and the long mate pair 
DNA libraries of these strains using the MiSeq sequencer, and performed in silico gap closing 
and Sanger sequencing. The assembled genomes were annotated the manually curated annotation 
in the genome database Cyanobase. 
These data will facilitate our understanding of diversity and evolution of the molecular processes 
among cyanobacteria phylum. This project is supported by the National Bio Resource Project in Japan.
